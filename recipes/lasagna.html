           <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
           <li>¾ teaspoon dried basil</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
           <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
           <li>¼ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
           <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
           <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
           <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
           <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
           <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
           <li>6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese</li>
           <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in plant-based sausage, meat substitute crumbles, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, 1 tablespoon parsley, sugar, basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles; cook 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse noodles with cold water.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, stir together egg, ricotta, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>To assemble lasagna, spread 1/3 of the sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella slices. Spoon 1/3 of the sauce over mozzarella and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan. Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Bake, covered with cooking spray-coated foil, for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake until hot and bubbly, about 25 minutes more. Cool for 15 minutes before slicing into 12 equal servings.</li>
        </ol>
